# Agrigrow
Agrigrow is a mini e-commerce website where anyone can buy, sell and transport farm products.
A full-stack application with user registration where farmers can list all their farm products. They can also get feedback and ratings from their buyers. Buyers can search through all products listed by all sellers, add their favorite products to the cart and place their order. Transport service providers can use this app to ship products from sellers to buyers. They can see all the listed products, sort the ones they think are convenient for them to transport and ship the product. Both seller and buyer can track the product status.
